# Guide for MEAN Stack

The MEAN stack is a pure JavaScript stack comprised of four main technologies, with a cast of supporting technologies:

- MongoDB—the database
- Express—the web framework
- Agular—the front-end framework
- Node.js—the web server

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

### Installation

MongoDB is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can download the latest version of MongoDB Community Edition from the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community).

### Getting Started

To get started with MongoDB, you can follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) tutorial.

## Express

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### Installation

Express is available on npm. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install express --save
```

### Getting Started

To get started with Express, you can follow the [Express Application Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) tutorial.

## Angular

Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.

### Installation

Angular is available on npm. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli --save
```

### Getting Started

To get started with Angular, you can follow the [Angular Quickstart](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart) tutorial.

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

### Installation

Node.js is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [Node.js Download Center](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Getting Started

To get started with Node.js, you can follow the [Node.js Getting Started Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/).

## MEAN Stack

The MEAN stack is a full-stack JavaScript solution that helps you build fast, robust, and maintainable production web applications using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.

### Installation

The MEAN stack is available on npm. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install mean-cli --save
```

### Getting Started

To get started with the MEAN stack, you can follow the [MEAN Stack Tutorial](https://www.djamware.com/post/5a9c9d4080aca7059c14297a/mean-stack-angular-6-crud-web-application).
